\chapter*{Acknowledgments}


\bigskip

I am grateful to Cynthia for giving me the opportunity to pursue this work, and for her insights and feedback on the research.  I would also like to thank my dear readers, Tod and Edith for the wonderful discussions that shaped my thinking. 

I have been fortunate to be part of the Personal Robots Group with its all star crew. I will miss Polly's love, hugs and punches. I want to thank my fellow investigator, Jin Joo, for welcoming me and showing me the ropes, and  of course my research partner, Kate, for being a bad influence and introducing me to violence against robots. I am grateful to the amazing post-docs, Brad, Hae Won, and especially Goren for all the crazy ideas and feedback. 

My family has always encouraged me to pursue my curiosity. I am thankful for my parents who taught me to think, and my sister who always has my back. I want to thank Gabi. Without her love and support for my dreams, I wouldn't have been here. A huge thanks to Audra for keeping me sane. Last but not the least, Sylvia for all the love and the inspiration.
